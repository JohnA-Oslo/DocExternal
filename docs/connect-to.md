# User setup

This section covers how to connect end users to Wanda.

## Overview
Users must have an account within the social media collaboration channel they will use to chat with Wanda -- existing private accounts can be used.

* Each user must be assigned a Unit4 ID in Business World as described in [Mapping Business World users to Unit4 IDs](ubw-ids-configuration.md#useridsmapping)
* The Unit4 Wanda bot must be added to the users' contacts within the social media collaboration channel


## Connecting to Wanda in the social media channel

Currently Wanda is not published as an official bot through Microsoft Teams, Skype and Slack, which affects how users add her to their contacts as this is done using private links which are presently distributed by the Unit4 People Platform team as required &mdash; contact the Unit4 People Platform for more details.
