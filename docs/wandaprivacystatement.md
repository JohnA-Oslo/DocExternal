You may be asked to provide to Unit4, or Unit4 may access, your Personal Information anytime you utilise this App. Unit4 and members of the Unit4 group of companies (**“Unit4 Group”**) may share this Personal Information with each other and use it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve Unit4 products, services and content. You are not required to provide the Personal Information to Unit4 via the App and you can choose not to by indicating you will not “Use Unit4 Receipt Recognition Service” and entering all expense information manually. However, if you chose not to do so, Unit4 will not be able to provide you with the services connected with the URRS and the App or the full functionality of the corresponding Service.

Here are some examples of the types of Personal Information Unit4 may collect and how Unit4 will use it:

#### What Personal Information Unit4 collects

- When you submit a receipt for processing within the App and associated Service, Unit4 may collect a variety of information, including (but not limited to) your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, meal preferences, location and (to the extent disclosed on the receipt) your credit card information.

#### How Unit4 uses your Personal Information

The Service will recognise the information contained in those receipts. The Service operates on the Microsoft Azure computing infrastructure and trains itself in the recognition of receipts of different users and different customers. The Service will send detected information back to you for confirmation via the App. The Service stores the unprocessed expense receipt, the detected information and your feedback data and utilises these to help the programme learn and do better next time.

* Unit4 may also use Personal Information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and send you important notices.

* Unit4 may also use Personal Information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Unit4’s products, services, and customer communications.

* Unit4 also collects data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. If Unit4 does combine non-personal information with Personal Information the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.

* To provide location-based services on Unit4 products, Unit4 may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location. This location data is collected and is used by Unit4 to provide and improve products and services.
