# Running user diagnostics

Wanda offers a diagnostics tool to help you verify that your Wanda set up is correct for each user.

The diagnostics tool is run by simply entering `#diagnostics` in the chat channel for a user.

Wanda then runs through each functional area and provides a status report with a simplified status report being returned to the user in the chat window. Additional information will be logged and can be provided by the Unit4 cloud organization.
